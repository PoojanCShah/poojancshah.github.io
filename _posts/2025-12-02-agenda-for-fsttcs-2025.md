I list down several directions which I have been recently interested in exploring, these are largely motivated by my thesis work during this semester. These are currently semi-technical, but my goal is to eventually formalize them and even more eventually answer them someday. 

### 1. Limits on geometric ID estimators

### 2. Spectral algorithms for detecting low-dimensional manifold structure 

### 3. Data driven algorithms for k means clustering
