Here are some interesting topics I discovered during FSTTCS which I want to learn about : \

1. Semi Definite Programming - apparently SDPs arise everywhere. Maybe I'll finally get down to studying Watrous' *Quantum Information Theory* 
2. Approximation Theory - it is the study of using polynomials to approximate functions. An interesting class is the study of *Tschebyschef Polynomials*. This method forms the workhorse of Tang's thesis
3. Lattices and Homomorphic Encryption - the ability to perform computation on encrypted data using lattices is *magical*. 
4. Foundations of cryptography - want to review one way functions, pseudorandom generators etc 
5. Theoretical physics - apparently Landau and Lifshitz  wrote a series of textbook on the *whole* of physics 
6. Boolean functional analysis
