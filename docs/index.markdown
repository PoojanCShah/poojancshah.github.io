### About


I am a 3rd year undergraduate student at the [Department of  Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/) of
 the  [Indian Insitute of Technology Delhi](https://home.iitd.ac.in/) . I enjoy thinking about problems broadly related to theoretical CS. 

I will be spending the winter semester of 2025 as an exchange student at the [Faculty of Mathematics](https://uwaterloo.ca/math/) of the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/).

### Research


I am currently exploring algorithms for clustering problems and applications of the Continuous Learning with Errors problem [(Report)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sAMgy_b85TmKmn6PrFv3pYO3LL50Jl6t/view?usp=sharing). 

During much of 2024, I explored an algorithmic famework based on the  [dequantization](https://ewintang.com/assets/tang_thesis.pdf) of Quantum Machine Learning and subsequently worked on Quantum (Inspired) algorithms for clustering problems. 

_preprint_ : [Ragesh Jaiswal](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~rjaiswal/) and Poojan Shah. [Quantum (Inspired) \\(D^2\\)-sampling with Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13351)


I spent the summer of 2024 as a research intern at the [Computer Science Group](https://www.quantumlah.org/research/group/Rahul-Jain) of the [Center for Quantum Technologies](https://www.quantumlah.org/) during which I explored quantum cryptography [(Training Diary)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/172Y9i1EXFuj7_xUx312oYL4hXghbKaMp/view).
