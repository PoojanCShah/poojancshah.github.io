### About 


I am a 3rd year undergraduate student at the [Department of  Computer Science & Engineering](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/) at [IIT Delhi](https://home.iitd.ac.in/) .  I will be spending the winter semester of 2025 as an exchange student at the [Faculty of Mathematics](https://uwaterloo.ca/math/) at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/). 

I am excited to join [Atlas Research](https://www.linkedin.com/company/atlas-research-ai/posts/?feedView=all) as a quantitative trading and research intern during the summer of 2025. I spent the summer of 2024  at the [Computer Science Group](https://www.quantumlah.org/research/group/Rahul-Jain) of the [Center for Quantum Technologies](https://www.quantumlah.org/) at the [National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg/) as a research intern.

### Research

I enjoy thinking about problems broadly under theoretical computer science including algorithms, cryptography, quantum information processing and machine learning. 

I am currently working on algorithms for clustering problems and applications of the [_Continuous Learning With Errors_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.09595) problem from [Lattice based cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice-based_cryptography). During much of 2024, I studied an algorithmic framework for efficient classical simulation of quantum machine learning algorithms referred to as [_Dequantized QML_](https://ewintang.com/assets/tang_thesis.pdf) and worked on applying it to clustering problems. During my time at CQT, I studied [_pseudo random quantum states_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10020) which are a  potentially weaker [cryptographic assumption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_hardness_assumption) compared to [one-way functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-way_function).
